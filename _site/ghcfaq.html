	<div class="panel-heading"><h4><a name="what"></a>What is the Grace Hopper Celebration?</h4></div>
		<div class="panel-body">

		The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing is "the world's largest gathering of women technologists". It is part technical, part professional development, part career fair, and an unbelievably awesome and inspring event. You can find more information on the conference web page: <a href="http://ghc.anitaborg.org/">Grace Hopper</a>.

	<div class="panel-heading"><h4><a name="scholarships"></a>What's the deal with the USF CS department scholarships?</h4></div>
		<div class="panel-body">

		The USF Computer Science department has received two very generous donations that will support at least 14 students to attend the 2017 conference. Each scholarship will cover conference registration and provide up to $1,000 to cover travel costs.

		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="panel panel-default">
	<div class="panel-heading"><h4><a name="registration"></a>So, that's $1,000 plus registration?</h4></div>
		<div class="panel-body">

		Yes, each award will cover the $450 conference registration and an additional $1,000 in travel costs.

		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="panel panel-default">
	<div class="panel-heading"><h4><a name="cost"></a>What is the cost to attend?</h4></div>
		<div class="panel-body">
		
		The main travel costs are airfare for travel to Orlando, FL and lodging for the days of the conference. We encourage room sharing to keep costs down. Hotel and Air BnB are both acceptable.

		Awardees will be responsible for costs in excess of $1,000, however the past two years the scholarships were sufficient to cover travel costs. In addition, if you are selected to receive an award you will be notified with all of the rules and restrictions you must follow in order to receive reimbursement (i.e., you can't fly first class ;)

		</div>
	</div>


	<div class="panel panel-default">
	<div class="panel-heading"><h4><a name="who"></a>Who may apply for the USF CS department scholarship?</h4></div>
		<div class="panel-body">

		Any person who will be enrolled as a USF student in Fall 2017 is eligible to apply for the scholarship. This includes both graduate and undergraduate students and all majors and genders! We only ask that your application demonstrate why you are committed to learning more about diversity in computing.

		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="panel panel-default">
	<div class="panel-heading"><h4><a name="newbies"></a>But, I'm only in 107 (or 110, or 112).</h4></div>
		<div class="panel-body">

		Great! We encourage applications from students who are just beginning the major.

		</div>
	</div>


	<div class="panel panel-default">
	<div class="panel-heading"><h4><a name="ghcscholarship"></a>What about the scholarships awarded by the conference?</h4></div>
		<div class="panel-body">

		All applicants are strongly encouraged to apply for a scholarship from the main conference: <a href="http://ghc.anitaborg.org/2017-student-academic/2017-scholarships/">Main Conference Schoalrship</a>

		If you receive a scholarship from the conference this is a great line on your resume!

		You are encouraged to also apply for the department scholarship in case your main conference application is not selected. If you are selected to receive a scholarship from the main conference you must notify the department scholarship committee immediately. You will not be eligible to receive both a main conference scholarship and a department award.

	<div class="panel-heading"><h4><a name="grace"></a>Who is Grace Hopper?</h4></div>
		<div class="panel-body">
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a> was one of the first computer programmers and an all around awesome lady. President Obama posthumously awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom last year. You should definitely check her out on You Tube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-vcErOPofQ">GHC on Letterman</a>

	<div class="panel panel-default">
	<div class="panel-heading"><h4><a name="ref"></a>Who should I select as my faculty reference?</h4></div>
		<div class="panel-body">
		
		<p>For this application, you should select the professor who you feel knows you best. If you are a 107/110 student you will probably want to select the professor of your current course. If you have taken more than one CS course then select the person you feel you interacted with most.</p>

		<p>Before you list someone as a reference you should always ask that person whether he/she will be able to provide you with a strong reference. You should never list someone's name before you have consulted with him/her. We recommend you simply drop by the office hours of the professor you wish to ask and tell him/her that you are really interested in going to GHC and ask whether he/she would strongly recommed you for the scholarship. This will demonstrate to your reference that you are really excited about going the GHC and will surely cause him/her to recommend you even more highly!</p>
