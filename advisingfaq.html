		<div class="panel-body">
			To sign up for an advising appointment visit the bulletin board between HR 544 and HR 545. There are signup sheets with 15-minute slots available for each CS advisor.

			If you are a CS major who is a Freshman or Sophomore based on number of credits completed then you <strong>must</strong> see an advisor <i>in person</i> in order to have your advising hold removed. Please <strong>do not</strong> email your advisor and ask him/her to simply remove your hold. The advising hold exists to make sure that you are on track with your degree requirements and your advisor will want to meet with you in person to discuss your progress.

		<div class="panel-heading"><h4><a name="group"></a>What about group advising?</h4></div>
		<div class="panel-body">
			There will be two group advising sessions that you may attend <i>if you did not attend a group advising session in the previous semester</i>. If you attended group advising in Fall 2016 then you will be required to have a 1-1 advising appointment for Spring 2017.

		<div class="panel-heading"><h4><a name="juniors"></a>I'm a junior. Do I have to be advised (or, may I sign up for advising)?</h4></div>
		<div class="panel-body">
			If your status is junior or greater then you will not have an advising hold. You may skip advising, however you are encouraged to either meet with your advisor 1-1 or to attend the <strong>Junior Group Advising Session</strong> scheduled for <strong>Thursday 4/13/2017, 11:45-12:45 in LS G12</strong>. During this session we will discuss course options as well as other things you should be thinking about at this point in your career for example internships, job search, grad school, and how to ask for a reference.

			Your advising session will be most useful if you come prepared! 
			<ol>
				<li>
					Carefully review the following sample course plans:
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yUku_2QvfR7mPx56Os490Laq4gpCKdLLgU7GZEF9abs/edit?usp=sharing">Course Plans - Declaration of Fall 2016 or Later</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RmqbC3wvyWZ-H2v81QoNZl2hpQ6MKIn6_Cql6bn95MY/edit?usp=sharing">Course Plans - Declaration of Major Before Fall 2016</a></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Review the class schedule and select any non-CS courses you plan to take. Make sure to think about completing your core requirements early (so you have time for extra CS classes later!). In particular, if you have not completed your RHET requirement you should plan to take a RHET class. Also, keep in mind that you must complete two semesters of a foreign language. 
				</li>
				<li>
					If you are considering a minor, plan to take a class in that field so that you know whether or not you'll want to pursue it. Also, think about where your minor classes will fit into the course plans above.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you plan to study abroad think about how that will alter your course plan. If you are on track with the major, you will be able to easily go abroad for a semester or even a year. Keep in mind that you will not be able to complete any of your major requirements while abroad, so plan to complete cores or minor requirements during that time.
				</li>
			</ol>
